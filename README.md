# Mobile Developer Technical Exercise

Hello,

Thank you for dedicating your time to complete the technical exercise as part of the application process. This exercise involves building a small application using a mock API. Take the necessary time to construct a robust applicationâ€”there's no need to rush. Our primary focus is on clean code and a profound understanding of the various tools provided by the Flutter SDK.

We have confidence in your capabilities and are eager to witness how you apply your technical expertise in the upcoming sections. Approach each question with confidence, and strive to showcase your skills effectively. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us.

## The Problem

Your task is to code a stock application using Flutter, utilizing the provided API. The application should encompass the following considerations:

- Refer to the complete API documentation [here](/api.md).
- Implement a user login feature.
- Enable users to view their portfolio and positions. Keep in mind that portfolio values change every minute, so providing a means for users to refresh the view would be beneficial.
- Additionally, include a screen where users can access company information for each position in their portfolio.
- Use this credentials to login, email: `john@example.com`, password: `password`.
- The api is located at: https://stock-server-theta.vercel.app/api
- You can use these sketch as a guide, but any ui you would like to achieve the same functionality.
- Send us the solution in a repository with instructions on how to run it locally.

Feel free to use the provided sketch as a guide for building the UI.

**Note**: We are not prioritizing design elements, so don't invest too much effort on the UX side.
**Note**: You can upload the solution to any git repositories you prefer; just ensure that you don't mention it's built for a technical exercise and avoid mentioning vest.

Once again, we appreciate your time and hope you enjoy the exercise!
